## [1. Let's build a Teacher interface](task_1)
### :page_with_curl: Task requirements.
Create a directory task_1 and copy these configuration files into this folder: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

  * firstName(string) and lastName(string). These two attributes should only be modifiable when a Teacher is first initialized
  *  fullTimeEmployee(boolean) this attribute should always be defined
  *  yearsOfExperience(number) this attribute is optional
  *  location(string) this attribute should always be defined
  *  Add the possibility to add any attribute to the Object like contract(boolean) without specifying the name of the attribute

Example:
```
const teacher3: Teacher = {
  firstName: 'John',
  fullTimeEmployee: false,
  lastName: 'Doe',
  location: 'London',
  contract: false,
};

console.log(teacher3);

// should print
// Object
// contract: false
// firstName: "John"
// fullTimeEmployee: false
// lastName: "Doe"
// location: "London"
```

## [2. Extending the Teacher class](task_2)
### :page_with_curl: Task requirements.

  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  location: 'London',
  fullTimeEmployee: true,
  numberOfReports: 17,
};
console.log(director1);

// should print
// Object
// firstName: "John"
// fullTimeEmployee: true
// lastName: "Doe"
// location: "London"
// numberOfReports: 17
```

    The class has a method named displayName. It returns the firstName of the student
  *  The constructor of the class should be described through an Interface
  *  The class should be described through an Interface

Requirements:

  *  You can reuse the Webpack configuration from the previous exercise to compile the code.
  *  When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
  *  Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

## [5. Advanced types Part 1 (task_5)
### :page_with_curl: Task requirements.
Create the DirectorInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

  *  workFromHome() returning a string
  *  getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
  *  workDirectorTasks() returning a string

Create the TeacherInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:

  *  workFromHome() returning a string
  *  getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
  *  workTeacherTasks() returning a string

Create a class Director that will implement DirectorInterface

  *  workFromHome should return the string Working from home
  *  getToWork should return the string Getting a coffee break
  *  workDirectorTasks should return the string Getting to director tasks

Create a class Teacher that will implement TeacherInterface

  *  workFromHome should return the string Cannot work from home
  *  getCoffeeBreak should return the string Cannot have a break
  *  workTeacherTasks should return the string Getting to work

Create a function createEmployee with the following requirements:

  *  It can return either a Director or a Teacher instance
  *  It accepts 1 arguments:
        salary(either number or string)
  *  if salary is a number and less than 500 - It should return a new Teacher. Otherwise it should return a Director
  Expected result:

```
console.log(createEmployee(200));
Teacher
console.log(createEmployee(1000));
Director
console.log(createEmployee('$500'));
Director
```

## [8. Ambient Namespaces ](task_8)
### Task requirements
Create a directory called task_3 and copy these configuration files into it: package.json, webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json.

The first part of will require that you build an interface and a type. Inside a file named interface.ts:

  *  Create a type RowID and set it equal to number
  *  Create an interface RowElement that contains these 3 fields:
      *  firstName: string
      *  lastName: string
      *  age?: number

You are building the next part of the application architecture. The goal is to save the entities to a database. Because of time constraints, you can’t write a connector to the database, and you decided to download a library called crud.js. Copy this file into the task_3/js directory.

Here it is
```
export function insertRow(row) {
  console.log('Insert row', row);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(1000));
}

export function deleteRow(rowId) {
  console.log('Delete row id', rowId);
  return;
}

export function updateRow(rowId, row) {
  console.log(`Update row ${rowId}`, row);

  return rowId;
}
```
Write an ambient file within task_3/js, named crud.d.ts containing the type declarations for each crud function. At the top of the file import RowID and RowElement from interface.ts.

In main.ts

  *  At the top of the file create a triple slash directive that includes all the dependencies from crud.d.ts
  *  Import the rowID type and rowElement from interface.ts
  *  Import everything from crud.js as CRUD

Create an object called row with the type RowElement with the fields set to these values:

    firstName: Guillaume
    lastName: Salva

Create a const variable named newRowID with the type RowID and assign the value the insertRow command.

Next, create a const variable named updatedRow with the type RowElement and update row with an age field set to 23

Finally, call the updateRow and deleteRow commands.

Expected result:
```
const obj = {firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva"};
CRUD.insertRow(obj)
// Insert row {firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva"}

const updatedRow: RowElement = { firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva", age: 23 };
CRUD.updateRow(newRowID, updatedRow);
// Update row 125 {firstName: "Guillaume", lastName: "Salva", age: 23}

CRUD.deleteRow(125);
// Delete row id 125
```
Requirements:

  *  When running npm run build, no TypeScript error should be displayed.
  *  Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
  *   The main file and the ambient file should both import the types defined in the interface file.
  *  You can easily test your ambient file by looking at the intellisense of your IDE when using the 3rd party functions.

```bash
# Create task file and set execute permission.
cp -r task_0 task_3

touch task_3/js/interface.ts
chmod +x task_3/js/interface.ts
